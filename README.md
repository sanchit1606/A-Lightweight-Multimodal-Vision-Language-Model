# Multimodal Language Model

This project implements a **multimodal vision-language model** that combines a vision encoder (SigLIP) with a language model (Gemma) to process both image and text inputs, generating textual outputs. The model is suitable for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, text reading, object detection, and object segmentation.

## Overview

* **Vision Component:** Utilizes the SigLIP transformer-based architecture for image understanding.
* **Language Component:** Leverages the Gemma language model for advanced text processing and generation.
* **Integration:** The model fuses visual and textual representations, enabling seamless multimodal reasoning and generation.

## Features

* **End-to-end Multimodal Inference:** Process both images and text for a variety of vision-language tasks.
* **Pre-trained Weights:** Includes a 3B parameter model pre-trained on large-scale datasets with 224x224 image inputs.
* **Extensible:** Designed to support fine-tuning for downstream applications.
* **Transparent Implementation:** Built entirely in Python, using open components.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arya2004/multimodal-language-model.git
cd multimodal-language-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Inference

The model supports inference via the `inference.py` script. You can provide an image and a prompt to generate a response.

**Example usage:**

```bash
python inference.py --image path/to/image.jpg --prompt "Describe the objects in this image."
```

* Image preprocessing and input preparation are handled automatically.

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning scripts and instructions are coming soon. The pre-trained model is designed to be adapted to specific multimodal tasks using your own datasets.
